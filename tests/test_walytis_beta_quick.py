"""Test that Walytis' core functionality works, quickly.

Make sure brenthy isn't running before you run these tests.
Make sure the brenthy docker image is up to date.
Don't run pytest yet, as test_joining() always fails then for some reason.
Simply execute this script instead.

If testing is interrupted and the docker container isn't closed properly
and the next time you run this script you get an error reading:
    docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict.
    The container name "/brenthy_test" is already in use by container

run the following commands to stop and remove the unterminated container:
    docker stop $(docker ps -aqf "name=^brenthy_test$")
    docker rm $(docker ps -aqf "name=^brenthy_test$")
