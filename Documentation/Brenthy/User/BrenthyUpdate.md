_Why you shouldn't worry about Brenthy updates!_

# Brenthy Updates

Brenthy has a fully automatic update system for itself and Walytis.
Since we strive for [full bidirectional compatibility between Brenthy & Walytis and their API libraries](/Documentation/Brenthy/Technical/BackwardCompatibilityGuarantee.md), you don't worry about updates breaking things you've built, because that shouldn't happen.

To learn how Brenthy's update system works, see [Update](../Technical/Update.md).
