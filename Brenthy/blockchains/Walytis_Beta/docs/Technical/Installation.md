_how Walytis is installed_

To install Walytis, [install Brenthy](/Documentation/Brenthy/User/InstallingBrenthy.md).
Brenthy and Walytis depend on each other, so installing Brenthy automatically installs Walytis.

## Uninstall
To uninstall Walytis, [uninstall Brenthy](/Documentation/Brenthy/User/Uninstall.md).
Because Brenthy depends on Walytis for its update system, it is nonsensical to uninstall Walytis without uninstalling Brenthy.
