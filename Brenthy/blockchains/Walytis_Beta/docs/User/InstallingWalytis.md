_how to install Walytis_

# Walytis Installation

To install Walytis, [install Brenthy](https://github.com/emendir/BrenthyAndWalytis/blob/master/Documentation/Brenthy/User/InstallingBrenthy.md).

Brenthy and Walytis depend on each other, so Walytis can't be installed without Brenthy, but installing Brenthy automatically installs Walytis.

# Uninstall

To uninstall Walytis, [uninstall Brenthy](https://github.com/emendir/BrenthyAndWalytis/blob/master/Documentation/Brenthy/User/Uninstall.md).

Because Brenthy depends on Walytis for its update system, you can't simply uninstall Walytis alone without breaking Brenthy.
