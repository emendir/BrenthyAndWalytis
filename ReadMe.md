# Brenthy & Walytis

_`4D61646520776974682073696E63657265206C6F766520666F72206D616E6B696E642E`_

Brenthy & Walytis are technologies that take the development of blockchain tech to a new level.
Walytis is a lightweight, flexible, accessible and application-oriented type of blockchain, and Brenthy is a framework to aid the development and deployment of new blockchain types.

Developed together, they share a repository because they rely on each other very strongly.

## [Walytis](Documentation/Walytis/Meaning/IntroductionToWalytis.md)

_A flexible, lightweight, nonlinear blockchain, built to be built upon._

Walytis is a type of blockchain that is essentially a fully distributed database-management system with a focus on accessibility, flexibility and lightweightedness.
Applications can create a new Walytis blockchain (i.e. a new database) whenever they need one.
While they can always add new data to it, existing data can never be deleted or modified.

## [Brenthy](/Documentation/Brenthy/Meaning/IntroductionToBrenthy.md)

_A framework for developing and deploying new kinds of blockchains._

Brenthy takes care of all the non-blockchain-related machinery like installation, update and auto-start of itself and its blockchain types.
It also provides API-infrastructure to ease the development of blockchain APIs for applications.
Using these ready-made features of Brenthy's allows developers of new blockchains to focus on developing their blockchain's core.

### What makes Walytis special to Brenthy:

- Brenthy uses Walytis: A Walytis blockchain lies at the core of Brenthy's update system.
- Developed together: Brenthy & Walytis were developed as one project, and were compartmentalised to facilitate other blockchain inventors in developing and deploying their inventions.
- Live in the same repository: The code for Brenthy & Walytis live in the same repository to ease their development, testing, installation & deployment.

## Getting Started

### Install or Run from Source

Ubuntu quick start:

```sh
# install prerequisites
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-virtualenv git

# download BrenthyAndWalytis
git clone https://github.com/emendir/BrenthyAndWalytis
cd BrenthyAndWalytis

# set up python environment (you can skip this if you only want to install)
virtualenv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r Brenthy/requirements.txt
pip install walytis_beta_api    # install API library

# run Brenthy, it will offer to install itself
python3 .
```

Brenthy wil ask you whether you want to install or just run it.

### Use Walytis

1. Install the `walytis_beta_api` Python package:

```sh
pip install walytis_beta_api
```

2. Start playing around in Python:

```python
import walytis_beta_api as waly
blockchain = waly.Blockchain.create("MyFirstBlockchain")
block = blockchain.add_block("Hello there!".encode())
```
